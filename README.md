# DX Survey Application ‚Äî Role-Based Branching

This project extends DX‚Äôs basic survey app to support **role-based branching**.  
Respondents now only see the questions relevant to their role (e.g. Data Engineer, Frontend Engineer, Product Manager).

## üöÄ Features

- Define **branching rules** per role using an admin matrix (Questions √ó Roles)
- Collect respondent **role** before survey and show/hide questions accordingly
- Store responses tagged with role for downstream analysis
- Simple **analytics dashboard** comparing responses across roles
- Fully editable through the Rails admin UI

| `SurveysController`                | Handles role-aware `take`, `submit`, `branching`, and `analytics` actions |
| `views/surveys/branching.html.erb` | Admin matrix to toggle visibility                                         |
